# Sentiment-analysis-for-social-media-using-VADER
The Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis tool (Clayton J & Gilbert, 2014) is a lexicon rule-based algorithm which is proposed to analyze the sentiment of social media content. VADER works well for social media data because it contains lexical items for some words which carry sentiment like emoticons, slangs, initialisms and acronyms which are widely used in social media texts. 

This is a python tutorial with an example to show how to apply Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER) sentiment analysis (Clayton J &amp; Gilbert, 2014) on social media texts.

In this Tutorial, we first computed the sentiment score for each title and comment using VADER, then drew histograms of sentiment distribution for each dataset.  Positive sentiment, score ≥ 0.05; negative sentiment, score ≤ -0.05; neutral sentiment, score is between -0.05 and 0.05.
